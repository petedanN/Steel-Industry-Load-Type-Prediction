# Steel Industry Load Type Prediction

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the **Load_Type** in a steel manufacturing setting. The dataset includes energy usage, reactive power, and CO2 emissions, helping to classify operational load types for better efficiency.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/851/steel+industry+energy+consumption)
- **Origin**: Data was collected from **DAEWOO Steel Co. Ltd** in Gwangyang, South Korea. The company produces various types of steel coils, plates, and iron plates.
- **Size**: 35,040 records with 11 columns.
- **Features**: Includes energy consumption, power factors, CO2 emissions, and time-related data.
- **Target**: 'Load_Type' (categorical variable, e.g., 'Light_Load').
